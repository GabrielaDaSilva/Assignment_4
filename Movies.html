The crew intends to investigate three planets and from visiting the first one, they notice that decades have passed due to the planet's proximity to Gargantua, a supermassive black hole.Towards the end, due to the time slippage around Gargantua, almost ninety years have passed in Earth-time since Cooper left, though he has barely aged. He awakens on a space station and is reunited with Murph his daugter, now a celebrated scientist who helped humans survive extinction and nearing death. She advises Cooper not to wait around to see her die, and urges him to find Brand, who may have settled on the other planet that could become their new home. Cooper steals a spacecraft and sets off on his new journey.</dd>

  <dt>- Bubble is a 2022 Japanese animated post-apocalyptic film produced by Wit Studio.</dt>
  <br/>
   <dd>In the near future, the world is overcome by bubbles that break the laws of reality. An explosion at Tokyo Tower concentrates all the bubbles in Tokyo, but makes the city uninhabitable because of gravity anomalies. Various young folk defy the restrictions, and live there anyway, using parkour tournaments as a means to barter and trade supplies. In one parkour team, the Blue Blazes, 18 year old Hibiki, is an exceptional parkour talent, but he avoids others due to a hearing ultrasensitivity. One day, Hibiki attempts to climb the tower because he hears a woman's song, and believes he sees a boy there. He almost makes it, but ends up falling into the ocean, where his final exhale combines with some of the bubbles to make a young girl. Uta is clearly new to being a human, but learns quickly from others. Hibiki names her "Uta" ("Song") because she knows the song he hears in his head. Uta and Hibiki train parkour together. When Uta touches Hibiki, her arm fades away into bubbles. Bubble activity starts up again, so the Tokyo residents need to flee. Uta goes to Tokyo Tower to stop it. Hibiki goes to save her. In the final scene they save each other, but Uta fades into bubbles. In her final breath, she tells Hibiki that he made it worth it for her to be human. With the bubbles gone, the citizens of Tokyo return and start to rebuild.</dd>
