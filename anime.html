<u><h1>My top 3 Anime</h1></u>
 <ol>
   <h2><li>Naruto</li></h2>
   <img src="./Hobby-Images/naruto.jpg" width="155" height="260">
   <p>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.</p>
   <p>It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.</p>
   <p>The story is told in two parts; the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years (Shonin Jump), and the second in his teens (Shipudden).</p>
   <p>Naruto is on of my top three because it teaches you perseverance as Naruto goes from being an orphaned outcask to a village hero through hardwork and optimism.</p>
   <p>Secondly, you get to watch other characters that are close to him develop with him through emotional and physical trauma teaching the viewer that there is a silver lining if you're willing to look for it.</p>

   <h2><li>Black Clover</li></h2>
   <img src="./Hobby-Images/black-clover.jpg" width="155" height="260">
   <p>Black Clover is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by YÅ«ki Tabata.</p>
   <p>The story follows Asta, a young boy born without any magic power in a world where your value and status is determined by you magic ability.</p>
   <p>The series focuses on Asta, a young orphan who is left to be raised in an orphanage alongside his fellow orphan, Yuno.</p>
   <p>While everyone is born with the ability to utilize mana in the form of magical power, Asta, with no magic however, instead focuses on physical strength.</p>
   <p>Conversely, Yuno was born as a prodigy with immense magical power and the talent to control wind magic. Both Asta and Yuno plan to become the next Wizard King.</p>
   <p> This anime is very similar to Naruto and I have an appreciation for the ideal to never give up on yourself and I try to practice this in real life</p>

   <br/>
   <h2><li>Sword Art Online</li></h2>
   <img src="./Hobby-Images/sword-art-online.jpg" width="155" height="260">
   <p>Sword Art Online is a Japanese light novel series written by Reki Kawahara and illustrated by abec.</p>
   <p> The series takes place in the near future and focuses on protagonists Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya and Asuna Yuuki as they play through various virtual reality MMORPG worlds.</p>
   <p>In 2022, a virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online (SAO) will be released.</p>
   <p>With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds.</p>
   <p>On November 6, 10,000 players log into SAO's open world cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out.</p>
   <p>The players must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of SAO if they wish to be free. Those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths.</p>
   <p>This anime makes it into my top three because of its originality and game-like world as well as the love story between the two main characters.</p>
   <p>It teaches the veiwer about team-work and knowing that you're never alone.</p>
